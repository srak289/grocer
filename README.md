Scenario
---
You are doing a fantastic job at Chada Tech in your new role as a junior
developer, and you exceeded expectations in your last assignment for Airgead
Banking. Since your team is impressed with your work, they have given you
another, more complex assignment. Your task is to build an item-tracking
program for the Corner Grocer, which should incorporate all of their requested
functionality.

The Corner Grocer needs a program that analyzes the text records they generate
throughout the day. These records list items purchased in chronological order
from the time the store opens to the time it closes. They are interested in
rearranging their produce section and need to know how often items are
purchased so they can create the most effective layout for their customers.

Menu Option One:
---

Prompt a user to input the item, or word, they wish to look for.
Return a numeric value for the frequency of the specific word.

Menu Option Two:
---
Print the list with numbers that represent the frequency of all items purchased.
The screen output should include every item (represented by a word) paired with
the number of times that item appears in the input file,
CS210\_Project\_Three\_Input\_File.txt. For example, the file might read as follows:
Potatoes 4
Pumpkins 5
Onions 3

Menu Option Three:
---

Print the same frequency information for all the items in the form of a
histogram.
Then print the name, followed by asterisks or another special character to
represent the numeric
amount.
The number of asterisks should equal the frequency read from the
CS210\_Project\_Three\_Input\_File.txt file. For example, if the file includes 4
potatoes, 5 pumpkins, and 3 onions, then your text-based histogram may appear
as represented below. However, you can alter the appearance or color of the
histogram in any way you choose:
Potatoes \*\*\*\*
Pumpkins \*\*\*\*\*
Onions \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Menu Option Four:
---

Exit the program.

Data File Creation:
---
Create a data file, with the naming convention frequency.dat, for backing up
your accumulated data. The frequency.dat file should include every item
(represented by a word) paired with the number of times that item appears in the input file.

This output file is created in the beginning of the program without user
intervention and is for backup purposes. For assistance with writing files, see
sections 7.1, "File Input," and 7.3, "File Output," in zyBooks.

Documentation:
---
Describe your code’s design and functionality. Include screenshots to support
your description. As you complete this work, your manager at Chada Tech is
interested to see your thought process regarding how you use C++.

Implementation Guidelines
---
For this assignment, your implementation plan must include at least one class
with public and private sections. For assistance with classes, see sections
6.2, "Using a Class," and 6.3, "Defining a Class," in zyBooks.
For this assignment, we recommend using Maps (section 11.4 in zyBooks) for
implementation. Maps do require precise coding syntax. However, you can choose
a different implementation option.
Apply industry standard best practices such as in-line comments and appropriate
naming conventions to enhance readability and maintainability. Remember that
you must demonstrate industry standard best practices in all your code to
ensure clarity, consistency, and efficiency. This includes the following:

Inserting in-line comments to denote your changes and briefly describe the
functionality of the code
Using appropriate variable, parameter, and other naming conventions throughout
your code


Optional Challenge: User Input Validation
---
Validating user input is a coding best practice. For an additional challenge
with this assignment, use input validation and error handling to anticipate,
detect, and respond to run-time and user errors (for example, make sure you
have option four on your menu so users can exit the program).


What to Submit
---
To complete this project, you must submit the following:

Grocery-Tracking Program
---
Submit your completed work as a ZIP file, including all Visual Studio project
files that are required to run the program. Reference the CS Visual Studio
Export Tutorial, linked in the Supporting Materials section, for guidance on
how to download the necessary ZIP folder.

Documentation
---
Submit your completed documentation of your code’s design and functionality as
a one-page Microsoft Word document with 12-point Times New Roman font, double
spacing, and one-inch margins. Include screenshots to support your description.
If relevant, any sources should be cited according to APA style.
